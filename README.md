# 🎙️ Echo Journal

**Echo Journal** is a simple, voice-powered journal app that lets you capture your thoughts, feelings, and experiences using your voice. Instead of typing notes, just speak — and organize your echoes with titles, descriptions, hashtags, and moods.

## 🌟 Features

✅ **Voice-based journaling** — Record your thoughts and reflections directly by speaking.

✅ **Custom titles & descriptions** — Add a title and a short description to each echo to make it easier to browse.

✅ **Hashtag support** — Tag your echoes with custom hashtags (e.g. `#happy`, `#love`, `#travel`) for better organization and searchability.

✅ **Mood selection** — Choose the mood of your echo, such as:
* 😄 *Happy*
* 😢 *Sad*
* 😡 *Angry*
* 😱 *Anxious*
* ❤️ *Loved*
* 🎉 *Excited*

✅ **Simple, clean UI** — Focus on what matters: your voice and your thoughts.

4️⃣ Save and review your echoes anytime.
